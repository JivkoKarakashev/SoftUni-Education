## Course Introduction

In the "JS Advanced" course, students will gain in-depth knowledge of the JavaScript language, such as the basics of syntax, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes, and writing functions. They will study more complex concepts such as function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course will develop algorithmic thinking. After successfully completing this course, students will have the opportunity to work with the DOM tree, manipulate it, and work with "events". Functional and OOP approaches to programming with JavaScript will be examined, and concepts such as inheritance, object composition, and prototype chain will be studied.

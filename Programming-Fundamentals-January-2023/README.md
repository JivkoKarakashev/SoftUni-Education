## Course Introduction

With "Programming Fundamentals", students begin to study SoftUni's internal program for comprehensive training of software engineers. The course examines fundamental concepts in programming, which are the basis for effective and high-quality training in the professional modules. Students build on the knowledge acquired in the Programming Basics course and begin to use more complex techniques and structures of programming such as: arrays, lists, objects and classes. Additional technologies necessary for every software developer are studied, such as HTML and CSS, HTTP, bitwise operations and others. The basics of web development are examined, as well as one of the most common technologies and tools, with which the course successfully builds an idea in students about the upcoming professional modules and the knowledge they will acquire from them in order to become successful software developers.
